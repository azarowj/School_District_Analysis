# School_District_Analysis

## Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to make determinations for school budgets based on reading and math scores. This is then further looked at to see if scores have any relationship with school size, exisiting school budget, and school type. We completed the analysis, and then found out that all reading and math scores for 9th grade students at Thomas High School are possibly fraudulent. As a result, we needed to redo the analysis disregarding these data points.
