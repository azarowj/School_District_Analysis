# School_District_Analysis

## Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to make determinations for school budgets based on reading and math scores. This is then further looked at to see if scores have any relationship with school size, exisiting school budget, and school type. We completed the analysis, and then found out that all reading and math scores for 9th grade students at Thomas High School are possibly fraudulent. As a result, we needed to redo the analysis disregarding these data points.

## Results
- The district summary was not affected
- The school summary for Thomas High School resulted in a lower Average Math Score, higher Average Reading Score, lower % Passing Math, lower % Passing Reading, and lower % Overall Passing scores.
- Replacing the Thomas High School 9th grader's math and reading scores with null values does not affect its performance relative to other schools.
- It has no affect on math and reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, or scores by school type.

## Summary
The only major differences seen after removing the math and reading scores for 9th graders and Thomas High School can be seen for Thomas High School itself. Namely, the average math score, average reading score, passing math percentage, passing reading percentage, and overall passing percentage. However, these differences were only seen in the tenths and hundreths of percents.
